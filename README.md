# Attendance-Project-using-Dllib-and-cmake-
We use cmake and dllib libraries here so it is better we download visual studio with C++ development installed. You can use this project or enhance the project in any way you like.
Things to install before carrying the project out:
1. Visual Studio 2019
2. C++ desktop development through visual studio
3. dllib and cmake libraries will be installed if not manually install them using the pip command
